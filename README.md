Bar chart by each animal species and the count for the total data set:

I started by creating a bar chart of each animal observed in total/overall thoughout all 3 years. From there I split by wild versus urban data. Along with wild versus urban, I also created a bar chart by year and urban/wild by year. Only 7 animals were observed during all 3 years to some degree in an urban and wild setting. With these 7 animals, t-tests were applied to determine if there was any significant difference between the frequency of observations in a wild versus an urban location. From these tests, Elk and Moose were the animals with a significant difference, being observed more frequently in a wild location than an urban one. From here, I located the 5 camera sites these animals were captured the most and recorded them, as they would be good locations to study further as possible wildlife protection areas.


One of the questions that we had with this wildlife data was how does weather impact the behavoir of animals and can we draw any conclusions based on that. In order to answer this question we first had to pull in historical weather data for each of our data points. We decided to look at the mean temperature and the total rain accumulation for each day and compared that to the sum of each animal type seen in that day. Since both of these data points are continous, we were able to genereate scatter plots for every unique animal and do a linear regression for each one. Outlined below are some of the main observations from these plots:

Mean Temperature:
    Overall, a linear regression probably isn't the best statistical analysis to perfrom on these data sets since some of them behave non linearly. It would be interesting to try and fit different trendlines to these plots in the future.
    - Mule deer had the highest R2 correlation to temperature with more deer occurances seen the higher the temperature is for the day
    - Humans had low occurances seen below 40 degrees F, but then above 40 degrees F the occurances of humans gets much higher. This makes sense due to humans not living in the wild and being able to pick days to go hiking when it is warm out.
    - Moose were interesting because that had a perfectly flat trendline in relation to temperature. This shows that moose don't really care about the temperature and are equally active whether it is hot or cold.
    - Raccoons were also interesting becuase the showed a negative correlation to temperature. This would make since if racoons are more nocturnal animals and generally avoid sunshine and heat.
    - Black bears only had 1 obervation on a day colder than 55 degress F and all other observations are seen above 55 degrees. This makes since if black bears are hibernating during the cold month and hence are only seen during warm days

Total Rain Accumulation:
    A lot of animals did not show a strong correlation with rain fall. This could be due to Utah not getting a lot of rain in general so we don't have a lot of data to look at. Also, animals generally don't change their habits due to rain. That being said, their were a few interesting data points to look at.
    - On days with high rain accumulation, there are much less humans seen. Just like with temeparute, this makes since due to humans generally avoiding rainy days for hiking.
    - Muskrats have one of the highest R2 correlation with rain and it appears to show that on rainy days their are more muskrats seen. This makes since because muskrats are semi aquatic rodents and so would prefer wetter weather.
    - Uinta ground squirrels also showed a high correlation with rain and were more active on rainy days.
    - Both Red Fox and Eastern Fox Squirrels both had a negative correlation with rain and seem to prefer drier days.
