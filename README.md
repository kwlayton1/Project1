# Project1
Plots to create:
1. Bar chart by each animal species and the count for the total data set:
I started by creating a bar chart of each animal observed in total/overall thoughout all 3 years. From there I split by wild versus urban data. Along with wild versus urban, I also created a bar chart by year and urban/wild by year. Only 7 animals were observed during all 3 years to some degree in an urban and wild setting. With these 7 animals, t-tests were applied to determine if there was any significant difference between the frequency of observations in a wild versus an urban location. From these tests, Elk and Moose were the animals with a significant difference, being observed more frequently in a wild location than an urban one. From here, I located the 5 camera sites these animals were captured the most and recorded them, as they would be good locations to study further as possible wildlife protection areas.

        
3. When is the best time of day to see a particular animal? (plot animal count by time of day) (Richard)
4. XY scatter plot of animal count vs human count (Jesse)

5. XY scatter plot of animal count vs all of our continuous weather metrics (Charlie)
6. Look at the categorical weathercode data (Richard)
7. Day time vs night time (Kat)
8. Impact of weather on humans hiking (Kat)
9. Look at animal data seasonally (Charlie)
10. Create a map with animal count by each station (geo api map)
